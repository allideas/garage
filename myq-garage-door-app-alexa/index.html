<p>Does Chamberlain Myq Work With Alexa Workarounds And Alternatives Smart Home Starter A MyQ Smart Garage Hub or a Chamberlain or LiftMaster garage door opener with MyQ is required in addition to the HomeBridge. The Chamberlain MyQ garage door opener does not directly work with Alexa. If you are vouching for Siri an additional purchase of MyQ. Link your myQ to other smart-home devices and platforms. For actions I didnt see a way to link or incorporate the simplecommands routines. Add Routine &ndash; Name it something like Open the garage door &ndash; Select the garage door and click add &ndash; click openclose as needed.</p>

<p>Voice Activating Your Garage Door By Ananthsrinivas Medium Besides add another 10 annually to make your Google Home Assistant work well with MyQ. The best value option if you go this route is the Meross Smart WiFi garage opener. Get alerted any time your garage opens closes or is left open. From my experience you cannot use Alexa to open MyQ-equipped garage doors even with the IFTTT applink and the Chamberlain subscription. Garage door openers are categorized as Smart Home Skills in the Alexa eco-system. While Alexa does not currently recognize garage doors natively you can still use MyQ with Alexa by implementing a work-around using SimpleCommands.</p>

Choose an invocation name like my garage door. Home or away protect your packages against theft damage and bad weather. Alexa open garage door one Alexa open garage door two Alexa open garage door three Alexa open all garage doors. This will give you the capacity to control your garage doors alongside other devices that are compatible with the Apple Homekit app as well as many other uses which I will cover. Since you can only close MyQ with a voice command the lack of voice command for opening the gate creates further security concerns.</p>
