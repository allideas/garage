<p>Is Your Garage Door Light Blinking Continuously Here S What You Should Do The safety sensors use an invisible beam of infrared light to detect obstructions in the garage doors path. It could also be that there is a communication issue between your garage door opener and the garage gate. If the overhead light is flashing you might have a problem with the safety sensors on either side of the garage door near the floor. Once you locate these wires look to see if any of them are disconnected. Either something is blocking their view of each other or their alignment is off or a wire to one is damaged. In this case you need to have the sensor fixed so the sensor would stop blinking red.</p>
