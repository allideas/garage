<p>Garage Door Opener Motor Not Working Repair Youtube This can be a common problem in garage door openers utlizing DC motors such as the Overhead Door Phantom 777CD or even the newer model Overhead Door Legacy 850 2029. I checked inside of the garage door opener and this was the view. A worn belt or chain and cable assembly can also make noise-tighten chain or belt tension to correct this problem. There are several parts inside the garage door opener that when starting to fail can cause the grinding noise you hear. Sorry Jack it came with the house When either the wall button or the remote button is pushed the opener humsbuzzes twice and then goes silent. Loud noises when a garage door is being operated can be either be the door itself or the door opener.</p>
