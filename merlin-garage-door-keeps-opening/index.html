<p>Overall its a pleasure experience to use Merlin and I would definitely recommend it to my families and friends. There are a few unusual factors that can cause your door open by itself. I have a BD Controll-a-door MPC4 garage door opener with a MR433 receiver kit attached to it. If the garage door is over 10 years old then it may be that garage door opener has worn-out the plastic cogs which is common with some brand of openers such as the Merlin. When any part of the device fails no matter how small it can affect the entire door.</p>
