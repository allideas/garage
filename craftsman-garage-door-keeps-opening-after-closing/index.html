If the lights stay on I recommend you check the gears. If the wires appear to be in good shape next look at the control button mounted near your side entry door. If it closes before that distance has been traveled it thinks something is wrong and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. The safety sensors are blocked. The plastic gears are designed to last 25 years.</p>

<p>Craftsman 1 2 Hp Chain Drive Garage Door Opener With 2 Remotes The door opens but wont close. Posted by grgdoorfix February 8 2021 Posted in Uncategorized Tags. Ive disconnected the chain from the door so the traveler just moves when I hit the switch. If the opener lights do not blink and it is a new installation check the down force. There are safety sensors at the bottom of your garage door. Incorrect travel settings When your garage door is installed the opener is programmed with a number that indicates how far down the door is expected to travel before its fully closed.</p>

<p>6 Steps To Program Old Craftsman Garage Door Opener Even after I adjusted the travel the traveler still stops and reverses after close. I have tried adjusting the down force but can not seem to get it rightNo flashing lights and the sensors seem to be aligned. I hope this helps. When your garage door opens or closes when you havent triggered the remote one possible cause is that a neighbors remote was programmed at the same time as yours. Turn in in the direction indicated to decrease the travel in about 12 increments until it no longer reverses. If it is old or dirty the button may stick.</p>

The plastic gears are designed to last 25 years. Generally if there is a lot of plastic gear shaving inside the garage door opener the door spring needs to be adjusted.
