<p>Garage Door Insulation How To Insulate A Garage Door Diy Project Just bought a home built in early 2000s the garage door bottom track and weatherproofing seal is falling off and Im looking to replace it. Remove the old seal. Seals for the top and sides of a garage door take the form of flexible neoprene rubber strips with a crease down the center giving them a V shape. If they are popping out it sounds like the door springs may need adjusting as it is putting too much stress on lifting the panels from the top if you have an opener. Lift the door just enough so the garage door track doesnt get in the way of the weather seal then slide out the old rubber bulb Photo 1. Remove the Old Garage Door Bottom Seal.</p>
