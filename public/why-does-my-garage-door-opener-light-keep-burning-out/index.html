<p>Garage Door Opener Flashing Led Light Door Not Moving Light Switch Enabled. Even if the light bulb was changed do not count that out just yet. It May Be the Light Switch. If you hear the unit click but the light doesnt come on then you most likely have a bad light socket. If the light is still not coming on it could be the light socket or the logic board. If this is the case the unit may need additional bracing to the ceiling to hold it steady.</p>
