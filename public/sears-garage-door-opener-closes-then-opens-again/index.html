When the garage door tracks or rollers are damaged or the garage door is not balanced your Craftsman opener will stop when opening. As is the case with so many issues at the home theres no one reason why your garage door closes then opens. If your garage door wont open or close the problem could be a bent track a broken torsion spring or a bad capacitor int he motor housing. Remove bell wire from opener terminals and operate from transmitter only.</p>

If the sensor or its setting is marginal the door may not have the additional force needed in cold weather. Remove bell wire from opener terminals and operate from transmitter only. If door weight exceeds a certain amount the safety systems in the opener will stop opening and close the door again to prevent damage to the opener the door or anything that might be caught on the door.</p>

<p>6 Steps To Program Old Craftsman Garage Door Opener If pushing the wall button and holding it does not make the door fully close then it is quite possible that your door is reversing itself because it is sensing undue resistance. Opened the garage door and it went up fine. If the garage door does not close completely or begins to close and then opens back up again. Or as machead3 states through vibration from ther drive train. Ive installed Liftmaster 365LM receiver to Liftmaster 2000SDR as an alternative since my other newer garage door opener is 315Mhz and have the 315Mhz remotes. This is a built-in safety feature that is there in the event that something or someone gets in the way of the closing door.</p>
