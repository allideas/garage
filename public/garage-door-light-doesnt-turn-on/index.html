<p>Reasons Why You Re Garage Door Light Isn T Working How To Fix It Sometimes the Light switch button is accidentally activated which causes the light to stay on. If the bulb works in the lamp screw it into the light socket of the garage door opener. The light on your garage door opener refusing to shut off may be inconvenient but there are three possible causes that could trigger the light to stay on past its four-and-a-half-minute factory default settings. If the light is still not coming on it could be the light socket or the logic board. Or if I just wait for the light to shut off by itself will work no problem. If playback doesnt begin shortly try restarting your device.</p>
