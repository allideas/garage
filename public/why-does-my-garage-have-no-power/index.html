<p><strong>Why Does My Garage Have No Power</strong>, Its consuming some extra power which puts a little extra load on engine so the engine has to shift some power to AC compressor and hence compensates with power to drive. I shorted out a power plug for a 12V outdoor lighting transformer and the sparks caused all the fixtures in the garage to lose power. You might have absentmindedly unplugged the operator as you were exiting the garage through your internal door to the house. I unplugged it and then tested it to determine that it does not power.</p>
