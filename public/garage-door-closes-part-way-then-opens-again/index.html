<p>Why Does My Garage Door Start Closing And Then Go Back Up Answer 1 of 6. When the door is in any position other than closed and the garage door opener is activated the door will close. Im sure there is more than one cause of this problem but for me the issue was that the door was getting snagged slightly and once the chain pulls with too much tension it has an automatic failsafe and it stops pulling and lets the door down. The logic board receives and responds signals to any remote. It goes partway down reverses direction and goes back up again. Some older garage door openers do not have nicely labeled adjustment screws for force and travel limits.</p>
