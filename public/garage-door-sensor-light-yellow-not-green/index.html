<p>Barquentine Outdoor Fisherman Light Nordlux Wall Lights Outdoor Wall Lighting Check if there are any objects impeding the door. Check safety sensor alignment The sending sensor which has the yellow light transmits the infrared beam to the receiving sensor which has a green light. This confirms that the beam of infrared light is being produced and read by both sensors. Also when both lights are lit up with a steady solid light this means both sensors are aligned correctly. If the green light is off check the wiring at the sensor and up at the motor head to make sure there is a good connection. Door sensors do go bad so if no light is showing at all you may need to replace them.</p>
