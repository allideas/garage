I suspect there is an adjustable limit switch in the motor gear box that determines when the door should stop moving downwards just before it touches the ground with a separate limit switch to stop it in the fully open position.</p>

If the door will not open manually then there is likely to be some damage to the door springs or the mechanism itself. This can happen to a newly installed garage door or an older one.</p>
