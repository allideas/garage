<p>Framing Question For Garage Door Track Mounting The Garage Journal The main purpose is to cover the rough framing and provide a mounting location for the garage door seal. Ive got this gap between the garage door framejamb and the concrete driveway. Its submitted by organization in the best field. You should leave at least your king and jack stud spacing agianst the wall. Probably the gap formed due to settling of the house or something. I fear snakes and insects making it into the garage but also dont like how it looks with the gap.</p>

You should leave at least your king and jack stud spacing agianst the wall. As you can see from the pictures it collects dirt and dog hair and just plain looks bad. Hopefully this shim will be enough to make the latch solid.</p>
