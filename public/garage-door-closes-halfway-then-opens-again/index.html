<p>Why Does My Garage Door Start Closing And Then Go Back Up Your automatic garage door comes with a limit setting that limits the amount of force it is allowed to exert in either opening or closing. If the door closes again shortly after opening adjust the openers force sensors. If it closes before that distance has been traveled it thinks something is wrong and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. Apart from being a big inconvenience such situations are potentially dangerous as the can act as easy access points for burglars. If the garage door makes contact with an obstruction while closing the door will reverse the opener will beep and the lights will flash 5 times. When the garage door opens about halfway or 5 feet from the ground and stops the up limit switch needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>How To Fix A Garage Door That Keeps Reversing If you havent had your door properly serviced in a long time than your springs may have a buildup of surface rust. Pull the emergency release cord to disengage the opener trolley from the door. When that happens the distance your garage door needs to travel may change. If your garage door keeps going back up after youve closed it the most common reason is because. To give you information about these the travel limit controls how far your garage door opens and closes during its operation while force limit controls how much pull is needed to get the door completely open. Garage door only opens half way then stops.</p>

<p>15 Reasons Why Your Garage Door Won T Open Or Close If the door closes before that set distance has been completed then the opener thinks theres an error and automatically reverses to prevent property damages or injury. If your garage door wont open or close the problem could be a bent track a broken torsion spring or a bad capacitor int he motor housing. To be honest it is usually one of those things thats best left to your garage door repairman. If this fails disconnect the garage door opener from the garage door to manually open the door. If anything enters the beam even briefly the door opens again. Turn the down limit switch screw clockwise one turn with a flat blade screwdriver if the garage door closes and then begins to open back up.</p>
