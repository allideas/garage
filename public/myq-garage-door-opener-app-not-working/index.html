No problems as I set up a routine so that my garage door was checked to be closed by 930pm every evening. Next download the MyQ app available for iOS and Android orif you have a LIftMaster garage door openerdownload the separate LiftMaster MyQ app also for iOS and Android. The same thing is happening to me as well.</p>
