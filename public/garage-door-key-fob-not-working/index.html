<p><strong>Garage Door Key Fob Not Working</strong>, Garage doors shut. As for the key fob it could be interference. After you have realized that the key fob is malfunctioning due to the weak or dead battery you should ensure you replace the battery as quickly as possibleIndeed a bad key fob battery can cause you severe headaches and confusion whenever you try rebooting it. A much easier attack is to use a radio relay that fools a vehicle with a proximity-sensing keyless entry into thinking the key is nearby.</p>
