<p>How To Fix A Wonky Crooked Up Over Garage Door Wessex Garage Doors Tighten the Hinge Screws. If I stand next to the door and pull down while it is closing it will close successfully. Also could be ground subsidence slumping. Old doors can drop and common problemssymptoms when this occurs are that the top of the handle side of the door hits the top of the frame stopping the door from closing. I have a Henderson Premier garage door which is catching on the bottom right frame when it closes as shown in the photo. This issue is usually the result of the screws in the hinge coming loose.</p>

It only has one nut on the overhead spring that can be tightened on the left and I am aware it is dangerous to do any work to it without properly securing it.

When I open it the second section the one beneath the uppermost section is catching on the upper horizontal door frame and resisting travel. Using a hammer gently tap the butt end of a pry bar in between the sideboardheader pieces and the garage door frame. If you have trouble finding where the door rubs against the frame take a piece of cardboard thats about 1 8 inch 032 cm thick and slide it in the crack between the door and the frame. Use a screwdriver to loosen the screws that are in the tracks to secure it to the garage door frame.</p>

A binding garage door happens when the door is nearly impossible to operate. To fix a binding door begin by loosening the screws that secure the track to the garage door frame. Also could be ground subsidence slumping. Another common problem that happens with roll up garage doors is that the tracks on the sides of the doors that help push the doors up get misaligned.</p>
