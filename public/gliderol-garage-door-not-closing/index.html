<p>Gliderol Remote Control Programming Youtube Should any Gliderol door take longer than this to open or close consult your local service agent. It just beeps at me twice. Door will begin to close to find floor position and upon reaching the floor the unit will beep 3 times to confirm.

Automatic garage doors should auto reverse when they detect an obstruction while closing. Get the door balanced by a Gliderol authorised service agent.</p>
