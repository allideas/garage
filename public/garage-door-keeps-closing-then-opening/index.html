You might need to consider replacing it if your door is not working properly or you may purchase a new opener. If your garage door keeps opening by itself after you closed it you may have to adjust your closed limit settingsThe garage door will close completely and then continue moving in the reverse direction leaving you with a partially open garage door. It may be your garage door sensor.</p>
