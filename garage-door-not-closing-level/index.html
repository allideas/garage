<p>My Garage Has An Uneven Floor Overhead Door When I say a long level I mean as long as you have or can. If the door panels appear level and the door opens and closes properly the problem is usually with the floor. If your garage door wont close unless you firmly hold the button there is probably something wrong with the sensors. If one side of the door is not in line with the other the door wont run smoothly in its tracks and when closed one side of the door wont close completely leaving an open gap. Considering this should garage door horizontal tracks be level. Something blocking the door.</p>
