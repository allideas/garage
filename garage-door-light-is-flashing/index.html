Each sensor will usually have a light. The first thing you ll want to do when your garage door light is blinking is to check to see if the lock button sometimes referred to as the vacation button is turned on and if it is turn it off. Defective safety sensors or faulty sensor wiring also cause the opener lights to blink 10 times. So it is power source&ndash;switch&ndash;Porch light&ndash;first light&ndash;second light. Your garage door opener is programmed with self-diagnostic capabilities.</p>

If the overhead light is flashing you might have a problem with the safety sensors on either side of the garage door near the floor.</p>
