<p>Garage Opener Light Blinking A Troubleshooting Guide Garage Door Medics A lot of homeowners will accidentally put their opener into lock mode by sliding a switch or holding a lock button too long on the wall control station. If the system is locked then the green indicator on the console will be flashing or the words Lock Mode will appear on the LCD display for Elite and Estate series openers. The constantly flashing wall button simply means that the door was either put into lock-out mode by someone using the wall panel control or for some reason it defaulted into lock-out. Repeat the safety reverse test after the adjustment is complete. If these solutions seem too complex or do not work feel free to contact a professionally trained technician. Typically the light feature on the LiftMaster garage door opener flashes ten times when something obstructs the safety sensor bean or when the sensors detect motion around the garage door.</p>
