<p>Why Does My Garage Door Start Closing And Then Go Back Up If the garage door reverses when closing after only traveling down an inch or so something is probably blocking the beam between the two safety sensors at the bottom of the rails or the sensors arent aligned. Often this issue is caused by a snapped spring or cable which will need prompt replacement to get the door up and running once more.
