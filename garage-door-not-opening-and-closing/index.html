<p><strong>Garage Door Not Opening And Closing</strong>, When a garage door descends on command but then immediately reverses itself the problem is usually with the sensor eyes along the side tracks or with the doors wheels binding in their tracks. If they suddenly feel much heavier than usual the springs arent taking on the weight of the doors like they should and they need repair or replacement. One quick way to test if the issue is spring-related is to unhook the door from the garage door opener and then try to open or close the door manually. If the door has come to a halt for no obvious reason check the door mechanics.</p>
