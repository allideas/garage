<p><strong>Garage Door Spring One Or Two</strong>, Garage door springs act as a counterbalance to the weight of all garage doors making them easier to open and close. With a double torsion spring application if the garage door is in the closed position and one of the two torsion springs breaks there is usually enough power in the other torsion spring for you to still lift the garage door and get your car in or out. However if you have an exceptionally heavy single door you may need two torsion springs. Some builders use only one spring when they install garage doors to save money but it may not be the best option for your particular door system.</p>
