<p>Is Your Garage Door Light Blinking Continuously Here S What You Should Do There is a possibility of a relay stuck on the logic board causing the lights to stay on. Ive got a weird one going on with my garage door opener and wanted to see if anyone might have any ideas. My tenant just recently vacated and when I checked the operation the light would not turn on. Its old enough that it doesnt have the eye by the door. Listen for the light relay on the logic board to. Turn off the sensory feature function.</p>

<p>Solar Power Light 3 Led Light Garden Outdoor Lamp Lumiere Solaire Exterieure Puissance 3 Led Bulds Haute Luminosite Etanche Cloture De Jardin Cour Mur Pathway L In 2021 Solar Powered Led I suspect the light bulb burned out with a flash and the high current during the burnout welded the contacts. After doing some troubleshooting I discovered the issue has to do with power being sent to the light sockets. Slide the cover off. If your Genie garage door light will not switch off it could be a problem with the wiring or hardware. To determine which one it is follow the steps below. To small screws at the very bottom of the cover and then one on the left and top right.</p>
