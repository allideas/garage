<p>8 Common Garage Door Problems And How To Fix Them Continuing to use the door when the rollers are off track can cause serious damage to the tracks. When a garage door is off-track it may get stuck hang loosely from the tracks or sit at an awkward angle. If that happens the cable may appear loose. If a garage door roller is worn out so much that it lost its radius meaning the tread part of the wheel has worn out it will pop out of the track because it is made to stay in the track due to the radius that it is manufactured. When your garage door is open the horizontal tracks are bearing nearly all the doors weight which mentioned earlier can be up to 400 lbs for residential garage doors. In other words if the garage opener cannot open the door Then it can make the cables jump off of the cable.</p>

When a garage door is off-track it may get stuck hang loosely from the tracks or sit at an awkward angle. The main reason to cause the door to go off-track from one bad roller or several bad rollers is the fact that if the door does not roll up and down properly in the opener is going to have a hard time opening and closing the garage door.

When your garage door is open the horizontal tracks are bearing nearly all the doors weight which mentioned earlier can be up to 400 lbs for residential garage doors. All the moving parts of a garage door need to be aligned for it to work properly. If your horizontal tracks are older or are made from low gauge steel a small impact can cause the tracks to. It doesnt happen each time but it is happening more and more frequently. When you have a garage door that is off track we STRONGLY discourage you from fixing it on your own as this may cause severe injuries and unnecessary hospitalizations on your part primarily if the door is not handled well.</p>
