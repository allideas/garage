<p><strong>Garage Door Motor Adjustment</strong>, An overhead garage door is a large heavy object and in order for it to operate properly it must be precisely balanced and adjusted. Repeated operation of the opener during adjustment procedures may cause the motor to overheat and shut off. If the door continues to creep open or quickly drops on its own it needs to be adjusted. Limit adjustment settings regulate the points at which the door will stop when moving up or down.</p>
