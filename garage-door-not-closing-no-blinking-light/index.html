<p>15 Reasons Why Your Garage Door Won T Open Or Close Why is garage door light blinking and not closing. If an object has misaligned your sensor eyes then it breaks the electronic beam preventing the garage door to close properly. The safety sensors use an invisible beam of infrared light to detect obstructions in the garage doors path. The remote will still open the door just fine but refuses to close it. Start with aligning the safety sensors. If the light is off the sensor itself is probably off and if the light is blinking it means something is getting in the way of the signal.</p>
