**Garage Door Opener Door Arm Angle**, Shortening the arm even though it is reattached higher on the door will force you to relocate where you attach the arm to the chain or whatever it is on the overhead track by moving that point closer to the door front of the garage which will result in a steeper angle on the arm ie it should be closer to straight up and down than angled. This is a very important measurement that determines if you will need an extension kit when purchasing your DIY operator. Attach the opener arm directly to the punched angle.
