2022 Audi Q7 Suv Digital Showroom Valenti Audi My 2019 Audi Q7 was programmed to open my garage door but a week ago it stopped working and when I go into settings the Garage Door function is greyed out and when I try to get into the function it says this option is not available at this time. Lastly simply go to the front of your car and point your garage door opener right below the drivers side headlight and hold the garage door opener button down until the turn signals flash three times likely about 20-30 seconds. We need to go to the garage main unit receiver there is a learn button with a red LED indicator we need to press this one the red LED indicator will blink slowly now go the homelink button and press it 1 second interval 3 times the third time the garage should openclose. Stand in front of the vehicle with your garage door remote and aim it at the drivers side front bumper approximately 3-18 away. Locate the wall mounted controls and disconnect the wiring. I am have been trying for two weeks to set up HomeLink for my garage doors with no luck at all and HomeLink themselves have been pretty useless up to this point.
