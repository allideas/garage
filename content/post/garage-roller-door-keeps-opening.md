**Garage Roller Door Keeps Opening**, Ive tried pressing the code button down for a long time 10-30s and pressing it then turning the unit off and on but the door still openscloses by itself At the moment Ive turned off the unit and am manually openingclosing the door. It appears that one particular remote causes the garage roller door to go updown by itself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated - thanks. I reset the unit and programmed 3 remotes without issue.
