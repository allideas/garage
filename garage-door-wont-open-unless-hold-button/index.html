<p>15 Reasons Why Your Garage Door Won T Open Or Close My Genie garage door closes fine on all occasions but it wont open unless I hold the wall button down. Door opens with a touch of the button. Door will only run open. There is a safety sensor mounted near the floor on either side of the door these sensors have electronic eyes that have to see each other or the door control stops the garage door from closing. Only the wall button will close it. This causes real hassle as I cant use my remote opener to open the door as well.</p>

It is a Craftsman. If the garage door closes without you having to hold the button down then you properly diagnosed the issue. Garage door will not close without holding down the wall button. The sensors could be dirty blocked or faulty. If they both have lights on then continue.</p>
