<p><strong>Merlin Garage Door Not Closing Fully</strong>, If youve checked for obstructions and made sure the lock button wasnt switched to the on position and still your garage door opener wont open all the way check to see if your garage door is balanced properly. Sometimes objects can fall into the garage door mechanism which can jam doors and stop them moving completely. If the garage door does not close completely or begins to close and then opens back up again the down limit switch needs to be adjusted. Overall its a pleasure experience to use Merlin and I would definitely recommend it to my families and friends.</p>
