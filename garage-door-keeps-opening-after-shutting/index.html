<p>Most Common Garage Door Injuries And How To Prevent Them There are four common problems with garage door sensors three of these homeowners can fix themselves. When the garage door is closing and it doesnt reach the fully closed position it assumes there is an obstruction in the way and then it reverses. If it closes before that distance has been traveled it thinks something is wrong and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. You might need to consider replacing it if your door is not working properly or you may purchase a new opener. There are safety sensors at the bottom of your garage door. What To Do If Your Garage Door Keeps Closing Reopening.</p>
