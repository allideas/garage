<p><strong>Garage Door Lintel Size</strong>, The width of the lintel could be equal to the thickness of opening depth in the range between l12 to l8 of the span. The lintel of a garage is a load-bearing beam that supports the opening in the framing where the garage door will be installed. The wood lintels are easily destroyed by fire and decay. Generally for a roller door you install the tracks and the support brackets for the curtain roll inside the garage opening for maximum use and in many cases because the average roll size for a roller door is between 300 and 450mm it needs to go behind the lintel to maintain drive through height.</p>
