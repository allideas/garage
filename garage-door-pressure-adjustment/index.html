<p>This is a safety function that stops the opener if it feels to much pressure if the door closes on an object person or pet. There are two screws one for the closing pressure and the other for the opening pressure. Twist the Open Force control to the left to decrease the force used to open your door or to the right to increase the amount of force used. Use both the Up and Down arrow buttons for adjustment. The benefit of a dual spring is that it each spring is under less stress and pressure from controlling only half the door and if one breaks the door.</p>
<h3 id="turn-it-counterclockwise-to-reduce-this-pressure">Turn it counterclockwise to reduce this pressure.</h3><p>Any suggestions By the way the light does NOT blink there is nothing blocking the safety sensors near the bottom of the door and the door operates freely and it is well balanced. If when closing your door its bottom edge contacts the floor and then reverses direction and raises again you will need to adjust your close force. Test the door with increased or reduced force. Turn it counterclockwise to reduce this pressure. If your door doesnt rise at least five feet when it is suppose to be opening hold the bottom of the garage door while it is lowering. The sensitivity is a function on all brands of openers that you adjust the strength the opener uses to open or close garage door. To decrease the amount of force required to reverse the direction of the garage door turn the knob or screw with a screwdriver counterclockwise one quarter.</p>
