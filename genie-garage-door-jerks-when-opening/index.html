<p>Top 10 Reasons Your Garage Door Won T Work How To Fix It A crooked door that jerks around or makes grinding noises could have fallen off the track. I had a chain come off the sprocket on my chamberlain garage door opener. Apparently this is pretty common and easy to fix.

<p>Why Do Garage Doors Jerk When Closing On Track Garage Door Be sure the garage door opener and springs are in good repair properly lubricated adjusted and balanced. If you notice the rollers squealing or squeaking as you close or open the garage door they are likely the reason for a jerking door. If it is be sure that the lenses are mounted five to six. It all depends on the configuration but you likely have a button that activates the door operator. What happens is that the garage door travels too far down and loads up with downward pressure thus causing a big jerk when the pressure is released.
