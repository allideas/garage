Drop pff height is about 280mm ceiling height should be 2600mm so finished opening would be around 2150-2200 I am leaving 50mm for some accidental mistakes like slab thicknesslevel cover of LVL lintel. Look for doors where the height can be far closer to the lintel height as a standard size. As most garage apertures are usually around 2200mm high then the 70 height 2134mm will always need an infill of some sort so be aware of maximising the opening width and height whenever choosing a new door. Since the middle bracket is longer than the end. As the roller mechanism and guides will be fixed behind the opening inside of the garage please check that you have enough room to fit the guides behind the piers and mechanism behind the lintel.</p>

The height of a standard sectional garage door like many garage doors will rarely match the lintel height of a garage and the most common height we encounter is a lintel height of 2250mm approx. Measure the opening height in three places at the left middle and right side of the opening. Since the middle bracket is longer than the end. The load on a lintel comes from.</p>

Garage lintels are unique in terms of height position and should ignore the height precedent set 21m by the house doorwindow headers. Since I had to raise the floor I have only 77 in height for the door. I went from 21m to 24m. Garage door which is 450mm max.
