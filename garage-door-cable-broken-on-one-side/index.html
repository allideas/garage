<p>How To Open A Garage Door With Broken Cable One side may lift a little bit higher on one side of the garage door. If one cable has been broken it means the other one is undergoing more tension trying to keep the garage door open. Probably the most common breakdown of components with standard up and over garage doors is that the suspension cable on either side of the door will snap causing the garage door to either drop down to one side often jamming between the surrounding frame or making the door its self become near impossible to openSometimes however it can be that both cables have broken usually. Garage door springs are alternately stressed and fatigued and these alternating forces weaken the springs over time. The cable on one side of the door snapped when the garage was crumpled but the other appears to be intact. Lift cables are under extreme tension and should not be serviced by anyone unfamiliar with a garage door system.</p>
