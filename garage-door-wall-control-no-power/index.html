<p>Chamberlain 1 25 Hp Whisper Drive Belt Drive Garage Door Opener With Myq And Wi Fi Compatibility And Battery Back Up Lowes Com Chamberlain Garage Door Opener Chamberlain Garage Door Quiet Garage Door Opener Verify if the door control panel is compatible with your garage door opener. I recently had my garage door opener intalled and it worked while the guy was here but later that night it would not work. I understand that my Raspberry Pi is isolated from the garage door opener circuits and because of this I have no idea how measure voltage at the door open switch or operate a transistor to short the wall switch to ground so I can operate the door. However in almost every case its just a matter of raising the door pulling down on the rope and then pushing the control button on. You can purchase a power tester at local hardware store for a couple bucks. Today the opener is not working.</p>

While this may seem like a no-brainer one of the most common causes of garage door opener failure is simply the result of the power cord working loose from the electrical outlet. I tried pressing it a few times but no response. Yesterday my wall-mounted garage door opener was working fine. The laptop power supply is plugged in to the same circuit as the garage door openers. If the door didnt move when you touched the bare ends of the wall control wires its likely theres a wiring problem.</p>
