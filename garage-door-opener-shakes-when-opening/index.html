They all were able to spin by finger turn and retensioned the chain. This may have helped a little but the door still shakes. If your opener is not plugged into an electrical socket it may be wired into a subpanel. If this is the case carefully look for a circuit breaker controlling the line. The motor that operates the opener is the primary source of vibration.</p>

The trolley appears to teeter up and down slightly as it makes its way down the rail. Garage door shakes when closing. When the door closes and gets about 12 way down it starts to shake noticeably. When screw is bent it will make opener shake really bad. It does not have any problem opening the door and seems to do it rather smoothly.</p>

<p>A Cottage With Character Garage Door Design Garage House House Exterior This loud noise will sound like a machine gun going off. Lift the door to waist level and let go. Lubricating rollers can also help with this problem. To help open the door many garage doors come with big torsion springs. Also opener could have a internal gear and sprocket about to give out.

<p>Torsion Vs Tension Springs What S The Difference Craftsman Garage Door Garage Doors Garage Door Extension Springs I have a 12 HP Craftsman chain drive garage door opener model 1395684. Most companies use a press fit pulley which is made up of two separate pieces attached by ball bearings onto the inner. It will only close if I adjust the downward strength of the opener. When the door closes and gets about 12 way down it starts to shake noticeably. The Genie Company is a manufacturer of garage door openers and its systems mount and operate in ways similar to most openers. Motor vibration transfers through the openers support structure and into the homes framing and drywall amplifying the noise.</p>
