<p>Garage Requirements For Bass Boat Storage Key Measurements I never even worried about it. Some of these designs offer taller ceilings and oversized garage doors for convenience. If the garage was flat with the driveway I would not have the clearence. Picking up boat on Saturday so well see. My garage door is 10 wide by 8 tall.

<p>New Ish Boats Garage Fitment Question Boats Accessories Tow Vehicles Picking up boat on Saturday so well see. Im glad to see these measurements. With the door down I gain about 34-1. We have found several homes we like but you cant have any boats outside parked in. They were all older andor smaller and not particularly tall boats. I am able to back my boat in with out lowering the power pole.</p>

<p>7 Foot Garage Door Clearance Planetnautique Forums Double check the height of your garage against the boat. Generally back it in straight about 34 of the way after lowering P-poles of course once in i raise them back up before pushing it all the way in disconnect put the go jaks on the wheels and push the nose in towards the corner then go to the back of the boat and push the boat forward towards the front corner of the garage. Fortunately Power-Pole gives you a little remote control. Keep in mind that a boat call a 26 footer could actually be -2ft. The engine might extend a couple foot behind the length of the boat. A garage will need backroom that equals the door height plus 18 inches and possibly more based on the installation of an automatic garage door opener.</p>

<p>Fit The Boat In The Garage Hack Youtube Wiil a Lanier fit under the 8 door as high as they seem to st on the trailer. Come check out the best Bass Fishing videos from BassResourceco. My current garage door is 611. Keep in mind that a boat call a 26 footer could actually be -2ft. A 24 pontoon might be 259length overall. The garage I had intended to store it in is 81 from the ground to the lip of the garage door when it is all the way up.</p>
